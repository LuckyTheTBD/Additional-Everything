Version numbers go like this x.y.z.n for the DATAPACK
X is the main release, this number will go up by 1 when I add a REALLY REALLY big update and add TONS of new content.
Y is the release number, these updates will have a decently sized amount of new content, and will usually have a new structure or two.
Z is a release of a small amount of content that isn't big enough for a Y increase.
N is bugfixes, if you don't like bugs, this is the release number for you.

For the RESOURCE pack the version numbers go like this x.y.z
X is 25+ new models
Y is 7+ new models
Z is a few new models
